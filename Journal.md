Keeping the momentum going with Denomin8r. I have a few goals for this year with this project, all of which involve getting more exposure. And I will accomplish those goals. People will start to see Denomin8r (aka DENOM) in NYC and perhaps other locations around the World. People will appreciate this project as a fun exploration of the potential for collage, the intersection of art and automatization, and the powerful potential of commentary with collage. The crowning achievement I can imagine right now (and I have to work towards it) is to create an art piece that asks the question, what if we feed a collage to itself, over and over again? What would I create as the 'artifacts' that are produced as a byproduct of the process? That is a question to ponder over more. 

**Where is there room for artifacts in a process that is purely digital but which is a simulation of an analog process?**

The first iteration of Chaos Source Transform is almost ready for deployment (though it is already being deployed). It's utility as a way to generate source images is matched, I believe, by its utility in framing how I understand the organization of my source code, and how the source code will continue to grow into next year. I definitely had to do a lot of refactoring during this development process, and benefited immensely in learning about using Python more fully. Now that all the methods are in place, until I create more, I can more rapidly produce works according to my desires. 

I definitely vibe more with images that are less processed. Especially if the intention is to produce a juxtaposition of two ideas, it's helpful for those ideas to be perceived clearly so the comparision rings out. Also, over-processing an image (with my current set of transforms, at least) tends to muddy an image. This is especially true of the slicing and grid transforms. The cool thing is that over time I will think up many new types of transformations. 

Experimenting with num_dups vs slices_per_dup for vertical duping. When the number of slices is large, anything less than 20 looks terrible.
It seems like if dups>=6, slices>20. For dups==5, slices==16 isn't terrible. Then the lower number of dups looks cool no matter what.
Maybe it has more to do with the width of the slices than anything else. Because the eye needs to be able to discern what is happening with any given slice in order to connect all slices comprehensively and perceive a form. 

Vertically stacking the portraits look good now. I can't wait to play more with that method to explore. To make totems and combine slices from different face. I can probably even weave two images together. Can I make a comment about blackface with a gif? I also like the faces with arrows on it for cosmetic surgery. //
